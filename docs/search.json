Using in-depth fieldwork, spatial analysis and computational methods, I demonstrated how the rise of credit scoring technologies and the spatial allocation of mortgages operate as critical market forces in the making of the middle class and the uneven desegregation of the post-apartheid city.\nThis thesis was awarded:\nthe 2021 National Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies by the PUCA-APERAU-Caisse des Dépôts.\nthe 2021 National Dissertation Award in Geography by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG).\na Special mention of the jury for the 2021 Humanities and social sciences PSL Dissertation Prize.\nPublications\nAll my publications are available through my CV or through Google Scholar\n\n\n\n",
