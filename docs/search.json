In particular, the thesis highlighted how the adoption of credit scoring technologies and the spatial allocation of mortgages became critical market forces for the making of the middle class while driving neighborhood change in the post-apartheid city.\nI use mixed methods combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. Over 18 months of fieldwork, I conducted interviews with market professionals and households, while engaged in participant-observation within a local estate agency in Khayelitsha, Cape Town’s largest black township. In parallel, I built a database of 900,000 residential sales to measure and map the evolution of prices and mortgages across the urban space.\nThis thesis was awarded:\nthe 2021 National Doctoral Prize in Urban Studies by the PUCA-APERAU-Caisse des Dépôts.\nthe 2021 National Dissertation Award in Geography by the French National Committee of Geography (CNFG).\na Special mention of the jury for the 2021 Humanities and social sciences PSL Dissertation Prize.\n\n\n\n",
