<!-- The postcard had a useless second scrollbar (in addition to the big one of distill). For some reason, I couldn't remove it with the CSS in custom.css. My only solution is to modify the source of the postcards::trestle template to remove this scrollbar. -->
<!-- Same for font family -->

Hi! My name is Julien Migozzi and I am currently a Research Associate in the [School of Geography and the Environment](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/jmigozzi.html) at the University of Oxford, for the ERC project [Cities in Global Financial Networks](https://www.citynet21.org/). From September 2021, I'll be a [USF Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.urbanstudiesfoundation.org/funding/grantees/dr-julien-migozzi/) at the University of Oxford.

As an urban and economic geographer, my research interests lie at the intersection of financial geography, urban studies and economic sociology. 

My work explores on how real estate technologies and finance reconfigure housing markets and renew forms and processes of urban segregation, focusing on post-apartheid South Africa.

I use mixed methods that combines qualitative approaches (interview, participant-observation) with computational and spatial analysis, relying on open source tools such as R or QGIS.

Prior to joining the University of Oxford, I held appointments at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. I earned my MA degree in Geography from the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and my PhD from the University of Grenoble Alpes. I'm also a Research Associate at the Research Labs [Géographie-cités](https://geographie-cites.cnrs.fr/en/geographie-cites/) and [PACTE](https://www.pacte-grenoble.fr/en).

I also occasionally write - and tweet - about rugby, especially when magic [happens](https://youtu.be/zoLDy8VTD0k?t=587).
